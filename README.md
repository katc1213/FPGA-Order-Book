# FPGA Orderbook
This project is based off an orderbook created by [FPGAnow](https://fpganow.com/index.php/fpga-order-book/). While their version utilizes LabVIEW FPGA and an Arty Artix-7 A100T Board, I will be referring off his documentation to create an orderbook on a Xilinx Pynq-Z2 board (with Zynq-7000 SoC) as a Vivado project, which will allow me to later apply other open-source interfaces or communication protocols to retrieve and display real-time market data.
